## Introduction
CARE is a utility token in an ecosystem that utilizes medical and health data and manages health information in a decentralized manner on the blockchain. The ecosystem has built-in incentives to help people understand and pursue their own health through the circulation of tokens, and to support the accumulation of case and multifaceted data to reduce the cost of medical treatment, tailor-made care, and the prevention of unwellness. In return for providing health data, CARE will be granted, and each individual will enjoy high value-added medical services using CARE as a resource, creating a virtuous cycle in which they can enjoy the fruits of future medical services in which they have invested their own data.  

CARE's medical data is not limited to data exchanged on the web or protocols for utilizing such data; the CARE team believes that the core of data lies within the human body and defines iPS cells as the most valuable hardware data cultivated from an individual. The CARE team believes that the core of data is in the human body, and defines iPS cells as the most valuable hardware data cultivated from individuals. We advocate a world where individuals own and manage not only sensitive information as digital data in medicine, but also iPS cells as analog data, and reinvest the revenue generated by the ecosystem in the development of iPS cell application technology and medical AI and health AI, thereby opening up a future health society that is optimal for each individual. We will create a token platform that opens up the future of a healthy society optimized for each individual.
